Design a logic device that can perform different bitwise logical and arithmetic operations on two 8-bit inputs A and B. The operation is selected by a 3-bit instruction (opcode). The operations supported are:
0 (OR): Perform bitwise OR.
1 (NAND): Perform bitwise NAND.
2 (NOR): Perform bitwise NOR.
3 (AND): Perform bitwise AND.
4 (ADD): Perform addition.
5 (SUB): Perform subtraction.
**Module Interface:**
module arithmetic_engine(
    input [7:0] A,        // 8-bit input A
    input [7:0] B,        // 8-bit input B
    input [2:0] opcode,   // 2-bit opcode to select operation
    output reg [7:0] result // 8-bit result
);
