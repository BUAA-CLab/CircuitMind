Design an 8-bit counter that supports two modes of operation using **synchronous reset**. The counter operates as follows:
*   **Step Mode (mode = 0):** The counter increments by 1 at each clock tick.
*   **Overwrite Mode (mode = 1):** The counter value is replaced with the 8-bit value provided at the `write_data` input at each clock tick.
*   **Reset (rst):** The counter can be synchronously reset to 0 using the `rst` signal. The reset should be effective on the rising edge of the clock when `rst` is asserted.
**Module Interface:**
module counter (
    input clk,              // Clock signal
    input rst,              // Reset signal
    input mode,             // Mode: 0 for step, 1 for overwrite
    input [7:0] write_data, // 8-bit data to write
    output [7:0] count      // 8-bit counter output
);
