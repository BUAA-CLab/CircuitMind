Design a circuit to store and read a single byte of data. The circuit supports both reading and writing operations based on control signals. It outputs data when reading is enabled, and the output is only enabled when the read operation is active and the `data_out` is valid. When `rst` is high, the stored data and output should be reset to 0.
Note: Reset signals must be processed in a clock-synchronized manner. The rst signal should not appear in the sensitivity list.
**Module Interface:**
module store_byte ( 
    input clk,              // Clock signal 
    input rst,              // Reset signal
    input read_enable,      // Read enable signal 
    input write_enable,     // Write enable signal 
    input [7:0] data_in,    // Data input for writing 
    output [7:0] data_out, // Data output for reading 
    output output_enable  // Output enable signal 
);
