{% set error_context %}
**Compilation Error Detected!** Focus your review on identifying and correcting compilation errors related to structural Verilog. Specifically examine:
- **Verilog Syntax:** Typos, incorrect keywords, and violations of Verilog syntax rules.
- **Module Definition and Instantiation:** Correct module definitions, proper instantiation with named port mapping, and accurate port connections.
- **Port Declarations and Connections:** Verify `input`, `output`, `inout` declarations, data type consistency, and correct port connections during module instantiation.
- **Structural Primitives Usage:** Ensure only allowed gate primitives (`and`, `or`, `not`, `nand`, `nor`, `xor`, `xnor`) and the provided `d_flip_flop` module are used and instantiated correctly.
