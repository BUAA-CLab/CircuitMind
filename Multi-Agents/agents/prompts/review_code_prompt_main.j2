**--- DESIGN DETAILS & CODE TO REVIEW/CORRECT ---**

**Design Requirements:**

{{ design_requirements }}

**Verilog Code to Review/Correct:**
```verilog
{{ code }}
```
{% if dff_module_code %}
**Provided `d_flip_flop` Module:**
```verilog
{{ dff_module_code }}
```
{% endif %}
{% if previous_execution_result %}
**Previous Execution Result:**
```verilog
{{ previous_execution_result }}
```

{% if retrieved_results_errors_pattern %}
**Note:** You are provided with a list of common errors that you should avoid in your design. Please ensure that your design does not contain any of the following patterns:
{{ retrieved_results_errors_pattern }}
```
{% endif %}
{% if retrieved_results_best_practices %}
**Note:** You are provided with a list of best practices that you should follow in your design. Please ensure that your design adheres to the following guidelines:
```verilog
{{ retrieved_results_best_practices }}
```
{% endif %}
{% if retrieved_results_circuit_designs %}
**Note:** You are provided with a list of circuit designs that you can use as reference for your design. Please ensure that your design follows the guidelines provided in the following circuit designs:
```verilog
{{ retrieved_results_circuit_designs }}
```
{% endif %}

**Based on execution results, carefully analyze the logs. If tests failed, identify the root causes and correct the logic, output connections, and ensure `output reg` is correctly driven by `d_flip_flop` output. If no failures, still review for structural correctness and adherence to guidelines.**

Additionally, **ALL MODULES USED IN THE DESIGN MUST BE PLACED WITHIN A SINGLE VERILOG CODE BLOCK.**
